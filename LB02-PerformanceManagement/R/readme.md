*Sample Code: [R-Code_VISUALIZATION-ggplot2-Examples-v3.R](https://github.com/sawubona-gmbh/BINA-FS22-WORK/blob/main/LB02-PerformanceManagement/R/R-Code_VISUALIZATION-ggplot2-Examples-v3.R)*

*Sankey Diagram Example: [R-Code_SANKEY-Diagram-Demo1.R](https://github.com/sawubona-gmbh/BINA-FS22-WORK/blob/main/LB02-PerformanceManagement/R/R-Code_SANKEY-Diagram-Demo1.R)*
 

**ggplot2** is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html). You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. ggplot2 is a **R package** dedicated to data visualization. It can greatly improve the quality and aesthetics of your graphics, and will make you much more efficient in creating them.
You can browse the [R-Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) a page which is dedicated to general ggplot2 tips that you can apply to any chart, like customizing a title, adding annotation, or using faceting.

Und weitere aktuelle Tools/Libraries zur Visualisierung, zu Dashboards, zu Graphical User Interfaces mittels R/RStudio    
+ [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)   
**Shiny** is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions. Shiny combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. Goto [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) where you can find a myriad of Shiny apps to be inspired by and to learn from. 

*Sample App: [The Genome Browser](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/genome-browser.html) a visualisation of ICGC data based on Circos, a way of visualising whole genomes*

+ [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html)  
Shinydashboard supports all the normal interactive functionality that Shiny does. In addition to all the normal Shiny inputs and outputs that can be present in a shinydashboard app, there are a few things that are specific to the structure of such apps. Goto [Examples](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/examples.html) for some example apps.

*Sample Dashboard: [Streaming CRAN Data](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/087-crandash/) a dashboard that displays streaming data from the RStudio CRAN mirror logs. The streaming data is a 1-week-delayed live stream of download logs from cran.rstudio.com*
