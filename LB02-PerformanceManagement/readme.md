## A) Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

*E.g. the blog #178 on [Visualization Tools and Learning Resources, February 2022 Roundup](https://flowingdata.com/2022/02/24/process-178-february-2022-roundup/)*

*E.g. The [Weighted Olympic Medal Counts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/07/upshot/which-country-leads-olympic-medal-count.html) by Josh Katz. It lets you change the score value for each medal to rank countries and depicts a short lesson on weighting and ranking.*

## B) Dashboards

A Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard, is a data visualization and analysis tool that displays on one screen the status of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important business metrics and data points for an organization, department, team or process. Dashboards are an integral component of most BI software platforms and are widely used to deliver analytics information to business executives and workers.
